  {
    question: "What is PoliceConduct.org?",
    answer:
      "PoliceConduct.org is a public-interest website for documenting police encounters, positive, negative, and everything in between, using a structured format that encourages clarity, evidence, and accountability.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this an anti-police site?",
    answer:
      "No. PoliceConduct.org is pro good policing. The goal is to recognize officers who serve professionally and respectfully, while also documenting conduct that harms public trust or violates rights.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the launch status?",
    answer:
      "This is a quiet opening. The site is live, but growth is intentionally slow while reporting, verification, privacy safeguards, and corrections workflows mature.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's on the site today?",
    answer:
      "The first published report is the founder's account of an encounter in Irving, Texas involving Irving Police Officer James Markham.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to create an account to file a report?",
    answer:
      "No. You do not need an account. After you submit, you receive a unique Submission ID. Keep it safe because it is required for follow-up and cannot be recovered or displayed again.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you accept anonymous reports?",
    answer:
      "Yes, sort of. We accept anonymous submissions, but during the quiet opening we manually verify reports before publishing. If a report is fully anonymous with no verifiable details, it may not be published. Include dates, locations, agencies, incident numbers, witnesses, or evidence links whenever possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I check the status of my report or request changes?",
    answer:
      "Email hello@policeconduct.org and include your Submission ID, your requested update or question, and the email or phone number you used in the original submission.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take for my report to appear on the site?",
    answer:
      "Reports are reviewed manually for accuracy and safety. We are currently working through a backlog, so please allow at least one week for review and publication.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which role should I select for my report?",
    answer:
      "Choose the role that best matches your connection to the event: Primary Participant if it happened to you, Witness if you saw it happen, Representative if you are filing for someone else, Legal/Professional Advocate if you are reporting as part of a case, or Concerned Citizen if you are reporting based on secondary evidence.",
  },
  {
    question: "I am a lawyer filing for a client. Which role should I use?",
    answer:
      "Select Legal/Professional Advocate or Representative, then use the description field to clarify your professional relationship to the participant while honoring their privacy preferences.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I forget my Submission ID?",
    answer:
      "Submission IDs are not recoverable and cannot be displayed again. Submit the form again and include a note that it is a duplicate or follow-up.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do you mean by evidence-forward?",
    answer:
      "We separate personal accounts (what someone says happened), supporting materials (video, documents, public records), and opinion or analysis (clearly labeled). The goal is a usable record that can be evaluated and improved over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why should the public report police interactions at all?",
    answer:
      "Police encounters can have enormous consequences, and the public deserves a realistic way to describe what happened. A respectful, professional stop deserves recognition. A dehumanizing or retaliatory encounter deserves scrutiny. The in-between is often where patterns start to show.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do you want from the public right now?",
    answer:
      "Two things: report positive interactions so great officers are recognized and professionalism is normalized, and report negative or concerning interactions with as much specificity and documentation as possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle privacy?",
    answer:
      "We avoid unnecessary personally identifying information, especially about private individuals. Reports focus on conduct, context, and verifiable details, not doxxing. If you have specific privacy concerns, add a note in your submission and our team will follow up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my name be visible to the public?",
    answer:
      "Reports are published anonymously by default. If you want attribution on a published report, contact our team and we will confirm your preference.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if police retaliate after I submit a report?",
    answer:
      "If you believe there has been retaliation, file another report about that incident. Retaliation should not go unreported.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you associated with law enforcement?",
    answer:
      "No. PoliceConduct.org is independent and not affiliated with law enforcement agencies or government entities.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I include personally identifiable information in a report?",
    answer:
      "Yes, but it will be redacted before publication. We do not allow doxxing of anyone, including yourself, witnesses, or officers.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of interactions can I report?",
    answer:
      "You can report any law enforcement interaction: good (de-escalation, professionalism, fairness), bad (harassment, retaliation, unnecessary escalation), and everything in between. If it involved an officer or agency, it belongs here.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can I report federal officers or agencies like the FBI, CIA, or ICE?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Federal officers and agencies are included. Submit the report with as much detail as you can and we will review it like any other submission.",
  },
  {
    question: "How far back can I go when submitting a report?",
    answer:
      "You can submit reports for interactions from any time. Keep in mind that reports older than two years are less likely to be helpful for verification or follow-up.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I do not know the officer's name?",
    answer:
      "That is okay. Share any identifying details you remember and one of our volunteers will do their best to identify the officer.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What if I cannot remember the exact date or time of the incident?",
    answer:
      "Provide the most accurate estimate you can. If you have photos or digital files, checking file info or metadata can help confirm the date, time, and location.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I submit a report for an incident that happened years ago?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Historical reports are valuable for long-term patterns, though reports older than two years are less likely to be useful for immediate verification.",
  },
  {
    question: "I have multiple videos. Should I submit multiple reports?",
    answer:
      "Please submit a single report for the full interaction and include all relevant files or links. This keeps review consistent and easier to process.",
  },
  {
    question: "I have a video of the incident. How should I include it?",
    answer:
      'Add a hosted link in the Evidence Links section (Google Drive, Dropbox, YouTube, iCloud, etc.). Make sure sharing is set to "Anyone with the link can view" so reviewers can access it.',
  },
  {
    question: "Should I include witness contact information?",
    answer:
      "If a witness agrees to be contacted, include their name and contact details in the Witnesses section. We use this information for verification and do not publish it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I report on behalf of someone else?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You may submit as a witness or on behalf of a family member or friend. Please explain your relationship to the incident in the description.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I was a witness and not directly involved?",
    answer:
      "Witness reports are valuable and can corroborate a primary account. Note in your description that you are reporting as a witness.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get in trouble for submitting a report?",
    answer:
      "In general, reporting your experience is protected speech, similar to leaving a review. We cannot guarantee outcomes in every situation, so please submit only truthful information.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will filing a report affect an ongoing legal case?",
    answer:
      "Sharing information publicly can affect legal proceedings. If you have an active case, consider consulting an attorney before publishing details.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you reduce defamation risk?",
    answer:
      "We focus on specific, factual descriptions, label allegations versus documentation versus opinion, encourage supporting materials, and maintain a correction process. Reports avoid unnecessary personal details and center on public-interest conduct.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this legal advice?",
    answer:
      "No. PoliceConduct.org is a documentation and public-interest project. Nothing on the site is legal advice.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know my report was received?",
    answer:
      "After submission, the page shows your Submission ID. Save it in a safe place. You need it for follow-up, and it cannot be recovered or displayed again.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's your corrections policy?",
    answer:
      "If someone identifies a specific factual error and provides credible evidence, we will correct it. If a dispute cannot be resolved quickly, the entry is updated to reflect the dispute and the evidence available on all sides. Use the Report Issue link in the footer to request a correction.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can officers or agencies respond?",
    answer:
      "Yes. PoliceConduct.org supports responses, clarifications, and additional documentation. If new credible information changes a report, we aim to update it prominently.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why would a report be rejected during manual review?",
    answer:
      "We aim to publish every report, but submissions may be rejected or heavily redacted if they include hate speech, spam, or private information about uninvolved third parties.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why are you a national nonprofit, and why Delaware?",
    answer:
      "Police conduct is a national issue, and we operate a centralized, secure database for all 50 states. We are incorporated in Delaware as a 501(c)(3) and comply with the solicitation laws of the states where we actively fundraise.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does my donation go to a specific state or city?",
    answer:
      "Donations go into our general fund to support the national platform. This helps us scale manual review and clear backlogs across jurisdictions so every report gets timely review regardless of location.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are donations tax-deductible?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, so donations are tax-deductible to the fullest extent permitted by law.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I donate?",
    answer:
      "Visit our donation page at policeconduct.org/donate for current ways to support the project.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is my donation processed?",
    answer:
      "We use Stripe for secure, encrypted donation processing and receive reduced nonprofit transaction fees through Stripe's Nonprofit Excellence Program. This keeps overhead low so more of your gift funds report review and database integrity. You will receive an automated tax receipt by email immediately after your donation is processed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is my report being reviewed manually?",
    answer:
      "Manual review helps protect privacy, remove unintended personally identifying information, and maintain data integrity before publication.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can my report be turned into an official complaint or commendation?",
    answer:
      "Not yet. We plan to support official complaint and commendation workflows in the future.",
  },

              as a 501(c)(3) and comply with the solicitation laws of the states
              where we actively fundraise.
