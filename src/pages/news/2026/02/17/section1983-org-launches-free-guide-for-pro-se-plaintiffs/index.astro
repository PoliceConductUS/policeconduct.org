        <h2 class="h4 text-uppercase text-muted mt-5">The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Every year, thousands of Americans have their constitutional rights
          violated by police. Most never sue. Of those who do, the vast majority
          cannot find an attorney willing to take their case — civil rights
          litigation is expensive, time-consuming, and doctrines like qualified
          immunity make outcomes uncertain. That leaves people with a choice:
          represent themselves or walk away.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who choose to fight, the legal landscape is hostile. Federal
          procedure is complex, case law is dense, and most existing resources
          assume the reader is a practicing attorney. Pro se plaintiffs are
          expected to meet the same standards as seasoned litigators, often
          while recovering from the very trauma that brought them to court.
        </p>

          What Section1983.org Provides
        </h2>
        <p>
          Section1983.org is written for people in crisis. Every page assumes
          the reader has no legal training and may be navigating the federal
          court system for the first time. The site currently includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>229 court cases</strong> — summarized in plain language with full
            citations, drawn from the U.S. Supreme Court, federal circuit courts,
            and district courts across the country.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>122 legal terms</strong> — explained without jargon, covering
            constitutional law, civil procedure, evidence, remedies, and qualified
            immunity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>13 step-by-step process guides</strong> — walking plaintiffs through
            each stage of a Section 1983 lawsuit, from preparing a case through post-trial
            appeals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>10 in-depth articles</strong> — on practical topics like how to
            write a complaint, how to name defendants, how to use AI for legal research,
            and what to do when no attorney will take your case.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In total, the site contains over 370 pages of content — roughly 18
          hours of reading — all free, with no paywall, no registration, and no
          advertising.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 text-uppercase text-muted mt-5">Built from Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Section1983.org was created by a pro se plaintiff currently litigating
          a Section 1983 case in the Northern District of Texas. The project
          grew out of frustration with the lack of accessible, honest resources
          for people representing themselves.

          <p class="mb-0">
            "When I started my case, I spent months piecing together what I
            needed from law review articles, court opinions, and legal blogs
            that assumed I already knew the answers. Section1983.org is the
            resource I wish had existed when I filed my complaint."
