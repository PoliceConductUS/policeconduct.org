              <strong>Dover, Delaware</strong> — A new initiative dedicated to transparency
              and public safety,
              <strong>Institute for Police Conduct</strong>, has officially
              entered its soft launch phase.

          Founded by a grassroots team of advocates and data specialists, the
          platform aims to provide a centralized, accessible hub for tracking
          and understanding police conduct patterns. By simplifying the way the
          public interacts with oversight data, the organization hopes to foster
          more informed conversations between communities and law enforcement.

          Starting Small, Dreaming Big
        </h2>
        <p>
          Rather than a full-scale national rollout, the team is currently
          focusing on refining its core tools and ensuring data integrity. This
          "quiet" opening allows the organization to test its systems and gather
          feedback from early users before expanding to a wider audience.

        <h2 class="h4 text-uppercase text-muted mt-5">How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>
          Because Institute for Police Conduct is in its infancy, its success
          depends entirely on community support. To reach the next milestone,
          the project is prioritizing two critical needs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Volunteers:</strong> We are looking for researchers, data entry
            specialists, and legal enthusiasts to help verify information and build
            out our database.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Donations:</strong> Every dollar goes directly toward server costs,
            secure data storage, and the technical infrastructure needed to scale.
          </li>
        </ul>

            “Accountability isn't built overnight,” says Founder. “By starting
            small, we ensure that every piece of data we host is accurate and
            every tool we build is useful. We aren't looking to grow fast; we're
            looking to grow right.”
          </p>
