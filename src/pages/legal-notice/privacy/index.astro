      <p>
        Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and

            activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with

            much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device
            you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other
            technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location
            (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect
            this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling

          Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions,
          such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK),
          Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access
          to and control over your personal information. You may review, change,
          or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country,
          province, or state of residence.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have
        certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include
        the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
        information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict
        the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data
        portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In
        certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
        processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by
        contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "
        <a href="#contact"> HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE? </a>

        We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
        data protection laws.
      </p>

        <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent
        to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied
        consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
        consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting

      <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the

        it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
        reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

        <strong>
          Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:
        </strong>
        You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any
        time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, replying

        us using the details provided in the section "
        <a href="#contact"> HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE? </a>
        " below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may
        still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages
        that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond
        to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
      </p>
      <h3>Account Information</h3>
      <p>
        If you would at any time like to review or change the information in
        your account or terminate your account, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
        delete your account and information from our active databases. However,
        we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
        troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal
        terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

      <h2>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.

        Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an

        from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
        validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable
        laws.
      </p>

      <h3>Request Verification</h3>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. We will only use personal information provided in your
        request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
        However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
        maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information
        for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
        fraud-prevention purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to
        collect additional information to verify your identity before processing
        your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed
        permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
      </p>
