        PoliceConduct.org exists to preserve public records of law enforcement
        interactions and support accountable, evidence-based discussion. Our

      <h2>MODERATION</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to remove, edit, or restrict comments that violate
        this policy or our Community Guidelines. Some comments may be held for
        review, especially if they include links, come from new commenters, or
        are flagged by the community. We may close comment threads when a topic
        is under active investigation, presents safety risks, or becomes
        unproductive.
      </p>

      <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>

      <h3>Why is my comment pending?</h3>

        will appear publicly.
      </p>

      <h3>Why was my comment removed?</h3>
      <p>
        Comments are removed when they violate this policy, are off-topic, or
        pose legal or safety concerns. We aim to be consistent and fair in
        enforcement.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I report a comment?</h3>

        comment requires urgent review.
      </p>

      <h3>Why are comments closed?</h3>
