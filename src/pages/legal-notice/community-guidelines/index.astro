      <h1>COMMUNITY GUIDELINES</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Last updated</strong>
        <strong>January 14, 2026</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to PoliceConduct.org! We're a community focused on transparency,
        accountability, and public trust in policing. Our goal is to build a
        supportive, safe, and respectful space where people can share their
        first-hand experiences and verified evidence related to law enforcement
        interactions. To make this possible, we ask all members to adhere to
        these community guidelines.
      </p>

      <h2>WHAT WE DON'T ALLOW</h2>

      <h3>1. Hateful Content</h3>
      <p>
        No hateful content of any kind is allowed. This includes, but is not
        limited to, content that is racist, discriminatory based on ethnicity,
        gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other
        characteristic. We stand for respect and equality.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Violence, Threats, and Bullying</h3>
      <p>
        Threats, bullying, harassment, or any form of harmful or violent content
        is strictly prohibited. This includes content that promotes harm to
        oneself or others. Let's keep our community uplifting and supportive.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Nudity or Sexually Explicit Content</h3>
      <p>
        PoliceConduct.org is a platform for reporting and reviewing police
        interactions. Nudity and sexually explicit content are not appropriate
        here and are not allowed in any form.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Misinformation</h3>
      <p>
        No spreading misinformation. PoliceConduct.org is built on trust and
        reliable information. Posting inaccurate or misleading content is not
        permitted, especially when it concerns public safety or incident
        details.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Spam</h3>
      <p>
        No spam allowed. This includes repetitive content, unsolicited
        promotions, or irrelevant posts that detract from the value of our
        community.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Doxing and Privacy Violations</h3>
      <p>
        Do not share personal information about others without their consent.
        Doxing or violating someone's privacy in any way is strictly prohibited.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Multiple Accounts and Impersonation</h3>
      <p>
        Operating multiple accounts, avoiding bans, using throwaway emails, or
        impersonating others is not allowed. PoliceConduct.org thrives on
        genuine connections and integrity.
      </p>

      <h3>8. No Self-Promotion</h3>
      <p>
        We encourage you to share your experiences, but not for self-promotion
        purposes. Linking directly to social media accounts (Instagram, TikTok,
        YouTube, etc.) with the sole intention of driving views or followers is
        discouraged and may be removed. We're here to engage and connect, not to
        promote and run.
      </p>

      <h2>WHAT WE ENCOURAGE</h2>

      <h3>1. Helping Others</h3>
      <p>
        PoliceConduct.org is a space where members can support one another.
        Share clear, factual experiences and helpful context that improves
        community understanding and accountability.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Promoting a Supportive Atmosphere</h3>
      <p>
        Be kind, considerate, and encouraging. Your words can have a positive
        impact, and we're all here to learn and explore together. Let's make
        sure everyone feels welcomed.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Cooperation to Maintain These Guidelines</h3>
      <p>
        We all share responsibility for keeping PoliceConduct.org a great
        community. If you see something that doesn't align with these
        guidelines, please report it. Your cooperation ensures we all enjoy a
        safe, respectful, and fun environment.
      </p>

      <h2>REMEMBER: ACCURATE CONTENT IS KEY</h2>
      <p>
        PoliceConduct.org is about documenting police interactions, and accuracy
        is at the heart of our mission. Misinformation, whether intentional or
        accidental, can harm public trust and safety. Always ensure your posts
        are accurate and informative.
      </p>

      <h2>CONSEQUENCES</h2>
      <p>
        Failure to follow these guidelines can result in the removal of content,
        suspension, or permanent banning from PoliceConduct.org. Let's work
        together to make this a respectful and valuable community for everyone.
      </p>
