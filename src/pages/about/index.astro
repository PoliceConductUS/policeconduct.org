              I have insomnia. One night I went for a walk to tire my body out
              so I could sleep. I was not committing a crime. But an officer
              followed and watched me anyway. I tried hard to disengage. At one
              point I sat down on the sidewalk, opened the news on my phone, and
              stayed there for 10 to 15 minutes and the surveillance continued.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was exhausted and irritated. I confronted him. I was rude. I
              swore. I demanded to be left alone. Instead of de-escalating, the
              officer escalated. He could have simply left the area for a few
              minutes so I could depart. When I said, "you can leave," he
              responded, "that is not happening." He created the situation by
              surveilling me without cause, then refused to eliminate the
              problem he caused. Moments later, I was arrested for public
              intoxication. I stopped drinking in 1988.

              My report, involving Irving Police Officer James Markham, is the
              first report on PoliceConduct.org.

          <strong>Share the good.</strong> PoliceConduct.org should be the place where
          great officers get recognized — the ones who treat people with dignity,
          de-escalate, and serve their communities well.

          Great officers save your cat, calm down your teenager, and even when
          they write a ticket, they do it fairly and respectfully. Nobody likes
          a ticket or an arrest, but the way it is handled can feel necessary
          and respectful or disrespectful and dehumanizing, all while officers
          protect their own safety and the rights of citizens.

          Mistakes happen. We want well-intentioned officers who make legitimate
          mistakes in the heat of the moment to learn and keep serving. But
          officers who harass or retaliate against law-abiding people should
          lose their job.

          I am a former Minnesota resident. My friends and coworkers were deeply
          affected by cases like George Floyd (2020), Philando Castile (2016),
          Jamar Clark (2015), Justine Damond (2017), Daunte Wright (2021), and
          Amir Locke (2022).

          And the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on January
          7, 2026, reportedly by an ICE agent, drastically accelerated this
          project. I did not have a working prototype when I heard about Renee.
          Now I am working 12 to 16 hour days to launch.

          PoliceConduct.org is my way of taking action: creating a place where
          people can document what happened, where patterns can be seen, and
          where accountability does not depend on whether someone has money or a
          lawyer. If you are confident enough to share your story, I hope you
          will. Your report could protect someone else.
